## Simple Blog API

A simple blog API I built for the first meetup of Moroccan PHP Artisans.

###Configuration:

* Download or clone the project
* Run `composer install`
* Configure your database and create a `.env` file in the main directory
* Run the migrations and database seeds: `php artisan migrate --seed`

Enjoy!
